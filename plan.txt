Points for Raju :
    - No need to do full refresh in case of modify or add or delete
        - Addition is straight forward
        - In case of modify or delete keep the previous row in seperate table
        (At a time allow only one change per trxn)
    - Optimize call of get_bse_stock_data
    - Check with Akshay about changing the profile value next day
    - Need to check if the transaction is active before adding entry in daily profile refresher()

Points for Jinesh :
    - Check if amount related front end code done
    - Check if dashboard design finalized
    - Reupload functionality to reset database table
